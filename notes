Keras with PlaidML (to support AMD gpu)

Done:
* Install tools
* Find and download SDG score
* Check which images are missing
Todo:
* Find out how to read images, and export them
* Find corrupted images
* See if I can train any network
* Make sure all images are valid
* Test data extension, mirror etc?

Some pictures are missing data
Hm, some of the pictures seems to be wrongly rotated. Use PatientPosition?
HFP Head First-Prone
HFS Head First-Supine
If patientposition doesn't exist, it seems to be rotated. Example: 300059

Hmm, beh√∂ver jag hitta bilder skullstripping? Finns fressurfer processed, men verkar jobbigt...
